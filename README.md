Feed Reader Testing
===================

This is a project created for Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.
In this project, I have implemented Jasmine tests to ensure proper functionality of the feed reader.

How to Use
----------

Clone the git repository

  `git clone https://github.com/mkkakau/feedreader.git`

Open the index.html file in your browser

  Jasmine tests are visible at the bottom of the page
